The optimized code for the curve P-224 was written by Emilia KÃ¤sper
and the optimized code for the curves P-256 and P-521 were written by
Adam Langley (both at Google) and distributed under the Apache License
2.0.

More precisely, the files ecp_nistp224_core.c, ecp_nistp256_core.c,
and ecp_nistp521_core.c are stripped down versions of ecp_nistp224.c,
ecp_nistp256.c, and ecp_nistp521.c, respectively, found in the OpenSSL
library, and thus derived work as defined by Apache License 2.0.

These designs and implementations are based on a previous
implementation written by Dan Bernstein.
